/*
 * Singleton is creational pattern : object creating machenisiem
     * This pattern ensure that only one object of perticular class
     * need to be created.All further refrences to the objects are refrred to the same 
     * underlying instance created.That instance will responsible to cordinetes to 
     * in whole applications.
     * 
     * We created the Singleton class as sealed which ensures that the class cannot be
     * inherited and object instantiation is restricted in the derived class.
     * The class is created with a private constructor which will ensure that the class is not going to be instantiated from outside the class.
     * Again we declared the instance variable as private and also initialized it with the null value which ensures
     * that only one instance of the class is created based on the null condition. The public property GetInstance is
     * used to return only one instance of the class by checking the value of the private variable instance. 
     * The public method PrintDetails can be invoked from outside the class through the singleton instance.
